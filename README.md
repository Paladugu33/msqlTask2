# msqlTask2

files task2_1,task2_2, task2_3 are done by creating and using mysql tables.

files task2_1_pd.py, task2_2_pd.py, task2_3_pd.py are done by using pandas.

task2_1.py , task2_1_pd.py --> to create table of name, address, zip_code, city of who have atleast one violation.

task2_2.py , task2_2_pd.py --> to get the list of business names who have atleast one violation.

task2_3.py , task2_3_pd.py --> to count the violations of each business.



All these are sucessfully running for small file but failing for large files.
